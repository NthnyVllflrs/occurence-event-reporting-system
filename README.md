# Occurence (Online Events Reporting System)

A simple web application to **report an incident** or **post an event** around you.

### Technologies Used
* [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)

### Features
* You can post incidents around you.
* Posts can include images for validity.
* Moreover, you can verify that particular event too for other users to know that the event is legitimate.
* The map view on where the event happened.
* Real time updates for event verify counter, trending tags/incident counter and etc.
* Knows where you are using geolocation.
* This system promotes [**crowdsourcing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing).
* Finally, it is a Single Page Application! Only the very first request from the server and all the files will be served, even the changing of routes doesn't need to reload the browser ([**Vue-Router**](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)). It enhances the user interactivity because the transition from one page to another is slick.
